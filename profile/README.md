Provider of global public transportation data.

![Stage: Planning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stage-Planning-informational?style=flat)

## What we provide

- Static transit data — *stops, routes, schedules and more.*
- Real-time transit data — *service changes and vehicle locations.*
- Predictions based on network analysis — *arrival times, etc.*
- Passenger journey planning.

Our goal is to make public transportation more easily available and convenient.

## Our benefits

- **We're open**. We allow our data to be used by anyone, and most of the source code is freely available.
- **We welcome community contributions**. Anyone can propose changes.
- **We generate some data ourselves**. Even real-time, although imprecise.
- **We don't hide any details**. This includes vehicle identifiers, operating companies, location update times, etc.
  
## Where our data comes from

- **Local authorities**. Usually they only provide real-time coordinates of transport vehicles.
- **Community**. Our users have the ability to propose and vote on changes to most of the data.
- **Algorithms**. We try our best to predict arrival times, adjust vehicle locations and more.

## Our competitors

### [MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/) — A non-profit organization that improves and extends mobility data formats.

➕ They aim to develop a sustainable, community-supported hub for international mobility datasets, and that is our goal too.  
🏴 They're an organization of analysts and researchers who know what they're doing. We're starting as one developer with a vision.  

### [Bustime](https://busti.me/) — A web-based public transport real-time monitoring and visualization solution.

➕ They reliably provide accurate detailed information.  
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 They only provide information directly to users.  
➖ They claim to be open-source, but they're not. The GitHub repo hasn't been updated for years. Contributions to data are limited.  
➖ They have different apps for web and mobile. The web version feels old and clunky, and doesn't even show a map.  

### [Yandex.Maps](https://yandex.com/maps/) — A mapping service that includes information about public transport.

🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 They only provide information directly to users.  
➖ They're completely closed-source and propietary.  
➖ They only show simple information and hide all of the details.  
➖ Their prediction algorithms have shown to be unreliable.
